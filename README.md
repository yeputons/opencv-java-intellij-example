# Installation

1. Open in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Find `opencv-3.4.2-1.jar` somewhere in `%HOME%/.m2/repository/org/openpnp/opencv/3.4.2-1/`
3. Extract `nu/pattern/opencv/%OS%/%BUILD/*` to your working directory (e.g. `windows/x86_64/opencv_java342.dll`)
   so the app can find it during startup.

Or:

1. Download all `*.jar` from http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/openpnp/opencv/3.4.2-1/ to a newly created `lib/` directory.
2. Add them as dependencies in IDE of your choice.
3. Repeat step 3 from above.
